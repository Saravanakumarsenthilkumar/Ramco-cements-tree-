# Ramco-cements-tree-# CO2 Sequestration Calculator

This project is a Python application that calculates and visualizes the CO2 sequestration potential of different tree species based on their characteristics and locations. The application provides a user-friendly interface for uploading datasets, filtering data, visualizing CO2 sequestration, and interacting with a chatbot for information about the advantages of trees in carbon dioxide sequestration.

## Features

- **Upload Dataset:** Upload a CSV file containing data about tree species, their characteristics, and CO2 sequestration.
- **Data Visualization:** Visualize CO2 sequestration per species, top species by CO2 absorption, and year-wise CO2 sequestration.
- **Filter by Year:** Filter the data by the year of plantation to see specific information.
- **Location Characteristics:** View characteristics of trees in different locations and their CO2 sequestration data.
- **Chatbot Integration:** Interact with a chatbot to learn more about the benefits of trees in CO2 sequestration.
